# Dynamically Add Title and Meta Tags on Route Change in Angular Application | Angular SEO

This is the demo application for demonstrating dynamically update web page title and meta tags on route change in Angular.

We will also implement SSR rendering so that each route can be shared on social media (like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) and Search Engines like google and bing can index it properly. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
